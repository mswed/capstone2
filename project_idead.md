A website aimed toward the VFX matchmove community. Matchmovers need camera information, specifically sensor size, filmback size and image resolution. The site will allow them to easily find relevant camera data based either on the camera make and model or on the show it is used on. The camera data will be sourced manually and via the imdb api.

## A bookmark/Favorite collector

A system to collect and search the users various social media accounts for items they bookmarked or liked. Will use a variety of APIs to access the user's data. As a starting point: Mastodon and BlueSky.
