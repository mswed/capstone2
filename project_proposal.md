# Project Proposal

## The Grumpy Tracker

A web application designed to serve the VFX Matchmove Artists community by providing centralized access to camera technical specifications based on make, model, or film project.

### Overview

The home page will display a directory of camera manufacturers, allowing users to drill down through categories or search directly for specific camera models. Each camera entry will include detailed sensor specifications and general technical information. Users can also search for cameras by film project, with project-specific data sourced from IMDb or contributed by community members. Additional features include actor height references and filmback manipulation tools.

### Technical Stack

This will be a full-stack application with equal emphasis on frontend and backend development. The API will be custom-built, with the database populated through manual data collection from verified sources.

### Platform

Desktop-focused web application.

### Project Goals

The platform aims to provide VFX artists with:

- Accurate camera technical specifications for shot tracking
- User-contributed camera data (with source verification)
- Project-specific camera usage information
- Community validation of existing camera data

### Target Audience

- Matchmove Artists
- VFX professionals requiring camera technical data

### Data Sources

- Camera manufacturers (ARRI, RED, etc.)
- IMDb for project information and basic technical details
- Community contributions (verified sources required)
